SURFACE_TRANSFER=0.9 ; Controls how fast an external source can heat a piece of tyre in contact with said source, usually asphalt and air (values 0-1)

ROLLING_K=0 ; Controls the rolling resistance heat generation 
PERFORMANCE_CURVE=tyres_temp_curve.lut ; Lookup table for temperature/grip relation	
GRAIN_GAMMA=1 ; Gamma for the curve grain vs slip. higher number makes grain more influenced by slip
GRAIN_GAIN=0.1 ; Gain for graining. How much gain raises with slip and temperature difference- 100 value = slipangle*(1+grain%)
BLISTER_GAMMA=1 ; Gamma for the curve blistering vs slip. higher number makes blistering more influenced by slip
BLISTER_GAIN=0.05 ; Gain for blistering. How much blistering raises with slip and temperature difference. think blistering more as heat cycles. 100 value = 20% less grip

SURFACE_TO_CARCASS=0.15 ; how fast the heat from the tire's surface transfers to the inner carcass
CARCASS_TO_SURFACE=0.4 ; how fast the heat from the tire's carcass transfers to the surface (this will be more than surface->carcass due to the carcass having a much greater mass)
CARCASS_TO_CORE=0.05 ; how fast the heat from the tire's carcass transfers to the inner air (core)
CORE_TO_CARCASS=0.008 ; how fast the heat from the tire's core transfers to the carcass (should be very low because air is a good insulator and has a much, much lower mass than the carcass)
