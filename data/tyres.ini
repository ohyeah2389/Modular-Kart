BLISTER_GAMMA=1 ; Gamma for the curve blistering vs slip. higher number makes blistering more influenced by slip
BLISTER_GAIN=0.12 ; Gain for blistering. How much blistering raises with slip and temperature difference. think blistering more as heat cycles. 100 value = 20% less grip

CARCASS_TO_SURFACE=0.5 ; how fast the heat from the tire's carcass transfers to the surface (this will be more than surface->carcass due to the carcass having a much greater mass)
CARCASS_TO_CORE=0.1 ; how fast the heat from the tire's carcass transfers to the inner air (core)
CORE_TO_CARCASS=0.012 ; how fast the heat from the tire's core transfers to the carcass (should be very low because air is a good insulator and has a much, much lower mass than the carcass)
