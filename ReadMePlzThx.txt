Thank you for downloading the Modular Kart Class 2 vehicle for Assetto Corsa. 
It is a work-in-progress in its physics and graphics, and is not complete or fully representative of a real kart, but I hope it will still be enjoyable to use.
Every single component of this kart for AC has been written, configured, modeled, recorded, or generated from scratch by me (with some occasional help from some of the members of the CSP Discord server for things like tire model tweaks and miscellaneous physics advice, as well as using some utilities written by the user Arch from that server). 
No part of this kart mod has been sourced from anywhere other than the template car distributed with Assetto Corsa by Kunos.
If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or notes that you'd like to share with me, you can contact me on Discord @ohyeah2389, or by email at ohyeah2389@yahoo.com.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

You should be able to drag-n-drop this downloaded zip file onto Content Manager and install it that way. Manual installation is also possible and recommended if you are comfortable with doing that.
If you are installing an update, please select "Clean installation" in the installation type dropdown in Content Manager's install window. Be aware that this will probably wipe your skins folder upon reinstallation of the kart.
If this process leads to any unexpected behavior, please let me know-- Content Manager's automatic installation of mods can often cause issues, especially with mods that are not formatted traditionally like this one.
